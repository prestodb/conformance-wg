## Why We Created a Presto Conformance Program?

* Consistency
Users want a consistent experience when interacting with any installation of PrestoDB, and where a difference exists, we want to give users an easy understanding of what to expect and avoid any confusion.

* Innovation
To enable more parallel innovation. Several organizations are already contributing to contribute to Presto Project. This means that everyone can improve their own implementations and contribute back to the project

* Timely updates
To remain certified, vendors need to provide the <latest> version of PrestoDB (TBD), so you can be sure that you’ll always have access to the latest features the community has been working hard to deliver. 

* Confirmability 
Any end-user can confirm that their distribution or platform remains Presto conformant by running the open-source conformance application (TBD) that was used to certify. 

* Support 
You got covered for community support, bug fixes, integrations for the certified release of PrestoDB


Presto Conformance Program is to ensure consistency, to avoid any confusion and provide confirmability to the end-user that their Presto distribution or platform remains Presto conformant by running the open-source Presto conformance application (TBD) that was used to certify by vendors. 

Note: This conformance program definition will evolve/revise over time as we find time to document, specify, and test current behavior and as the functionality of Presto itself evolves.


Scope of the Program

Establish the conformance definition for downstream implementations of Presto and/or other tools built to interoperate with Presto, for final approval by the TSC.
Develop a conformance test suite to provide a "pass" or "fail" result based on the conformance definition, for final approval by the TSC.
Draft the “Conformance Guide” documentation describing the conformance program testing process.
Work with the TSC and Linux Foundation staff to establish a process by which participants in the Presto conformance program will demonstrate the conformance of their products and services.
Update and revise the conformance definition and test suite on an ongoing basis to maintain alignment with new significant releases of Presto.
